This project is a Sudoku board. It will scan the file and filled in a char[][]. By printing the board, you will call toString and print out the 9*9 Sudoku board.

Part 1: Define a SudokuBoard Class
Create a template for the board class (SudokuBoard or Board, whatever you want to call the class) that you will complete in Part 2 and 3 of this long program assignment.

Part 2: Reading in a board data file
The next thing that we want to be able to do is load a starting state of a Sudoku board into our class. We will use a made up plain text data file extension which we call .sdk format. Inside a data1.sdk Download data1.sdkfile, we might have something that looks like this:

Part 3: Printing the Board
Add a toString() method to your class that will allow you to print the board to the screen. You choose the format of how this looks - I encourage you to make it "pretty" rather than just printing the data to the screen in a grid, but ultimately this decision is up to you.

Part 4: Test your Sudoku functionality
To test that everything works, you will need to create a main class that creates an object of your class given a file path and then prints the resulting object to the screen.
