# Sudoku â€“ Program \#1
For this assignment for CS 143, we import an incomplete sudoku puzzle from a file and prints the board to the screen in a particular way. This is all that we will do for the first assignment in the Sudoku series; we will later add in testing to make sure the rules of Sudoku are followed and after that generate code that auto-solves the Sudoku puzzle.
## Part 1
Create a template for the board class, including field, constructor, and toString
## Part 2
Load a starting state of a Sudoku board into our class. We will use a made up plain text data file extension which we call .sdk format. A well-formed .sdk input file will always have nine rows, and each row will have exactly 9 characters, which are digits 1-9 or a period (representing empty).
## Part 3
Add a toString() method to your class that will allow you to print the board to the screen.
## Part 4
To test that everything works, you will need to create a main class that creates an object of your class given a file path and then prints the resulting object to the screen.
